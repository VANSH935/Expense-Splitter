This project now supports group-based expense management where users can track shared expenses, see who paid, and understand who owes whom. The user interface has been improved for clarity and ease of use, calculations have been fixed to ensure accurate expense splitting, and a receipt-style summary helps users review expenses clearly. The application has been tested with different group sizes and expense values for reliable results.
